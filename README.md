**Admin Taxonomy Filter** helps you to filter posts or custom post types in the admin area (the post list table) by custom taxonomies. It's similar to filter posts by categories, which is supported by default.

The plugin supports filter by multiple taxonomies and has settings to let you choose which taxonomies are filterable.
